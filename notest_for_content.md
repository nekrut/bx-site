# About

## Mission
The Center's mission is to bring together researchers who are developing and applying computational biology and bioinformatic approaches across a wide range of biological questions. In order to enhance Penn State's recognized strength in this area, the Center will continue to foster collaborations, contribute to education and training, and improve external visibility and reputation.

## History
The Center was initially founded in 2003 by Francesca Chiaromonte, Ross Hardison, Arthur Lesk, Kateryna Makova, Anton Nekrutenko, and Webb Miller. It was heavily involved in early genomics efforts, including UCSC, mouse, etc... The center and its activities also gave birth to the Galaxy project, etc...

## Graduate programs
Students interested in pursuing graduate studies with Computational Biology and Bioinformatics as the main component have several programs to choose from. The right choice depends on the exact type of research you are interested in, as well as your  educational background. The most common options are:
* [Bioinformatics and Genomics (BG)](https://www.huck.psu.edu/content/graduate-programs/bioinformatics-and-genomics)
* [Molecular Cellular and Integrative Biosciences (MCIBS)](https://www.huck.psu.edu/content/graduate-programs/molecular-cellular-and-integrative-biosciences)
* [Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](http://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/graduate/Graduate-Degree-Programs-CSE.aspx)
* [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB)](http://bmb.psu.edu/graduate)
* [Biology](http://bio.psu.edu/graduate-portal)
* [Statistics](http://stat.psu.edu/education/graduate-programs)


## Training grants
Traning grants typically cross departmental boundaries with the intent to supplement existing graduate programs. When you are a student enrolled in a graduate program at Penn State, you are welcome to apply for these training programs. They provide additional training that is not usually part of a graduate program. This may include additional courses, seminars, tutorials, or research.
* [Computation, Bioinformatics, and Statistics (CBIOS) Training Program](https://www.huck.psu.edu/content/graduate-programs/computation-bioinformatics-statistics)
* [Biomedical Big Data to Knowledge (B2D2K)](https://www.huck.psu.edu/content/graduate-programs/penn-state-nih-bigdata-training-program)

# Events

There are several regular events at Penn State that are of interest to researchers in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Some of these include:
* [Bioinformatics and Genomics Retreats](https://www.huck.psu.edu/content/graduate-programs/bioinformatics-and-genomics/annual-retreat)
* [Center for Medical Genomics retreats](https://www.google.com/search?q=psu+center+for+medical+genomics+retreat)
* [Weekly Wednesday Wartik Genomics Lecture Series (WWWGLS)](https://wiki.bx.psu.edu/WWWGLS:_Spring_2017)
